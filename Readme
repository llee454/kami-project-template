Kami Project Template Readme
============================

This Git repo defines a usabel project template for Kami development.

The Kami model that you are developing should be stored under Instance. This template assumes that the project has a single rule named "main", and that the module is named mainMod.

If you change either of these you will need to update the import statements in Target.hs in BuildVerilog and BuildSim.

To compile your model into verilog. Go to the BuildVerilog directory, run make, and run the buildVerilog.sh script.

To generate the Haskell simulator, Go to the BuildSim directory. Edit the HaskellSim.hs file to include handlers for any external method calls your module makes. Then run make followed by buildSim.sh.
